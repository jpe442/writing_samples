# Writing Samples

Here you will find samples of a few different sorts of industry tech writing samples I have written in the past. Some are from different product teams I worked on, some are for personal software I developed like DoDate.

You can also find some of my documentation work publicly facing from my last role at Mesosphere (D2IQ) hosted on the [D2IQ Conductor documentation website](https://docs.d2iq.com/dkp/conductor/)
