# Writing Samples

Here you will find samples of a few different sorts of industry tech docs I have written in the past. They are all in Markdown format (*.md), and so you can simply click on the Markdown file to render on GitHub. Some are from different product teams I worked on, some are for personal software I developed like DoDate, some are from previous employment - such as the AWS Verified access docs - and some are just examples.
